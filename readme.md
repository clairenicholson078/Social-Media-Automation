## ‚ùì What is this?

This is a desktop app for all platforms (Mac, Windows, and Linux) which can automate all of your social media activity. As you can see in the preview, you can create scenarios like when you post something on one social media, it will be re-posted to another one (or same one but on a different account). 

This app also lets you schedule posts for any social media. For example when you don't want to be online at a certain time or maybe your audience is in a different timezone than you.

Just imagine you are a big corporate like Marvel and you want to post certain news on all social media accounts at the same time. 

Maybe, you are a social media influencer and you want to like/retweet all the posts which show up with a certain #Ô∏è‚É£hashtag on twitter or Instagram.

This app does that.

### ü§î Problem

I like being on social media but if you want to grow your audience they really make it hard to do so. First, you have to manage so many of them. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, Youtube, and the list goes on and on. Second, you have to be active on them. Now one person can be active on 1 or two of them but being active on all of them daily is a cumbersome task. But they won't take you seriously if you are not active and not engaging them with posts (or putting one) which results in you not having enough audience or exposure on that platform.

They are doing this because they want to promote their paid products. In Facebook they ask the person who posted for money to make this post reachable to all of his/her followers while LinkedIn offers paid membership based on how active you are on their platform. 

Ultimately, they track who is active and who is not and order other's feed based on that. If you are active then you will get audience automatically which is organic to your content  and which will make you use (or be active) on that platform more than other platforms. 

So, this is their way to attract you by giving you incentives every once in a while. It's a common psychology practice.

But I don't have 1 hour a day for each one (and how could I? there are dozens of them) and I want to be active for that shiny incentive which I am lured into. 

### üí° Solution

The solution to this problem is a bot. It will act as a logged in user and do the same activities as the user. So that platform thinks that the user is active and automatically helps the user to gain more followers and bigger audience reach.

## ü§® How  will it work?

We will use libraries like Google Puppeteer, ElectronJS and official API's to automate. It will mimic the same steps you would do on the web but it will do it automatically without human interaction. You can always see what it's doing and intervene/stop it at any point in time.

## ‚ö° Features

 - üíØ Totally Free for personal use
 - üîí Complete Privacy (we don't even have servers to store your data)  
 - üöÄ Fast and effective !!!
 - ü§Ø Numerous use case and possibilities

## ü§® When it will be ready?
That's where we need you.

#### Yeah, I can help. I am a highly experienced developer
We need someone like you to create a coding architecture so that code can be scalable to any use case. Also, as this is open source, there will be lots of PRs with junky code which will need to be refactored. We need you to use your expertise in that area. 

#### Yes, I am learning programming and I think I can help
Well, you are at the right location. Have a look at the issues and take one which you think you can fix. Also just looking and understanding the code will help you learn a few tricks. You can also add comments to existing code. Even small comments can speed up the developing process for others. 

#### okay, but I am not a developer
That's fine. Not everyone has to be one. You can think of tasks which is troubling you and which you think can be automated. Raise an issue here. Maybe some developer might have the same problem and decide to work on it which will benefit us all.

#### oh yeah, I am a social media influencer and I have a use case in mind

That's exactly why these technologies has been invented - to solve the problems we are facing in our day-to-day lives. Please write/explain your use case in the issues section and we will incorporate it into our codebase soon.

#### I am a social media manager and I can explain how each social media works

Well, we have been waiting for you. Pick up an issue which suits you and comment on it.
